Session:
	session is memory created in the server, for each user when we make first request.
	
	each session will have a session id.
	
	to access the session we need to send session id to the server for each request.
	
	session id will be send to the browser using a cookie.
	
	cookie: is a small file generated in the server and send to the client (browser) through response object.
	
	browser will send the cookie containing the session id to the server in the subsequent requests.
	
	server will take the session id from the cookie using request object and makes session available to the servlet/jsp.
	
	session will have time out . that means if user dont make a request for a long time then the server
	will destroy the session. though the client have session id, cant access the session after expiration.
	
	if the browser missed seesion cookie then also we cant access the session.
	
	cookies : are two types
	
		1. stateless: are stored in the browser memory. once the browser is closed cookies are destroyed.
		2. statefull : are stored on client disk. statefull cookie are created when we set cookie timeout.
