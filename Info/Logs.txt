 What Are Logs in Programming?
Logs are messages generated by a program to record important events during its execution. These can include:

Errors

Warnings

Informational messages

Debugging details

System performance or user activity

Think of logs as a diary or black box of your program ‚Äî they help developers understand what happened, especially when something goes wrong.

‚úÖ Common Use Cases for Logs:
Debugging: Find bugs or exceptions.

Monitoring: See how an application is behaving in production.

Auditing: Track user actions or system changes.

Performance Tracking: Identify slow parts of the system.

üìù Logging Example in Java
You can use System.out.println() for simple logging:

java
Copy
Edit
System.out.println("Program started.");
System.out.println("User clicked the login button.");
But professional applications use logging frameworks like:

Java Util Logging (java.util.logging)

Log4j

SLF4J + Logback

‚úÖ Example Using Java Util Logging
java
Copy
Edit
import java.util.logging.*;

public class LoggingExample {
    private static final Logger logger = Logger.getLogger(LoggingExample.class.getName());

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        logger.info("Application started");

        try {
            int result = 10 / 0;
        } catch (Exception e) {
            logger.severe("Exception occurred: " + e.getMessage());
        }

        logger.info("Application ended");
    }
}
üìÇ Where Are Logs Stored?
Console (during development)

Log files (in production) ‚Äî e.g., app.log, error.log

Cloud / centralized systems like:

ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)

Splunk

Datadog
