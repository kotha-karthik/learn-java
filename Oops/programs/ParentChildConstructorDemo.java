/*In Java, when a child class constructor is called, the parent class constructor is automatically called before the childâ€™s constructor body executes.
This is to make sure the base class is properly initialized before the subclass adds its own behavior.*/
/*If the parent class doesn't have a default (no-arg) constructor, and you don't explicitly call super(...), Java will try to insert super() by default.
If that default constructor doesn't exist, you'll get a compilation error.*/
