IP address: a unique id which helps you to identify a system over the network. (internet protocol address).


protocol: is a software which has set of rules, to transfer the data over the network.
	
	1. tcp/ip ( transmission control protocol and internet protocol 
	2. http 
	3. https (hypertext transfer protocol and secured socket layer).
	4. ftp ( file transfer protocol )
	5. udp ( user datagram protocol )

portno: is used to identify a (server/client) software in a system we need a portno.
	
	0 to 1000 ports are used by welknown servers.	

	0 to 65535 (logical)


socket programing.

server will be waiting in a system on a particular port.

client will make a request to the server program by using an ip address and a port no.

once the server receives the request , server will accept the client and creates a socket object which contains client information ( ipaddress,port no,protocol ).

once the server receives and creates socket object , server will also gives response to the client software, now client also creates
a socket object which contains server information.
